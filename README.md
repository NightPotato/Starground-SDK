# Starground-SDK
This is an unofficial modding SDK for the game Starground which you can find on [Starground Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2793380/Starground/). Please do not report issues for this tool within the [Starground Discord](https://discord.gg/SVZfZfF42t) or Offical [Starground Modding Github](https://github.com/chip003/starground-modding)


#### Important Information
This is not the game's Modding API. This is just an editor extension that makes generating mods and exporting them for the game's format easier. Due to the fact that we will be a little behind on game updates as we are not part of the team working on Starground, this repo will be creating releases for each of the game updates that break the functionality of this extension.

#### Modding Documentation
Need help getting started on making your mod? Checkout the [Modding Documentation](https://github.com/chip003/starground-modding/wiki) for the game. Some of the content will be different and you can read about how this extension changes the process on our [Documentation](https://comingsoon.com/).

### How to Install Starground SDK
You can get the latest version of this project from the Releases section of this github repository. Just Un-Zip the release files into you desired directory and open the project with the Godot 4.3 Editor.
